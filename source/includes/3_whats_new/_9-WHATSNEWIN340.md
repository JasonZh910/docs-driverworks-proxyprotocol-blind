## Whatâ€™s New in 3.4.0

### Blind Proxy

A new capability has been added to the proxy called [always\_send\_level][1]. If value is true, then the SetTargetLevel commands are always sent regardless of current level values. This is useful if the blind device does not support two-way communication and is controlled outside of the Control4 operating system.
